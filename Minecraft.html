				<h2> What Is Minecraft?&nbsp;</h2>
				<p>Minecraft is a survival game where you have to find food, build shelter, find materials, and more. Minecraft is a game replicating getting stranded on an island and you have nothing but a map. As you go on in the game you will find new resources to upgrade your things. But you will have to build swords to fight off mobs and creatures. To win the game you have to defeat the ender dragon, which is way harder than it sounds. </p>
				
				<h2>How much is Minecraft?</h2>
				<p>Minecraft does cost $19.99 to download, but it does come with some free characters to use. Once you pay the $19.99 you don't have to pay anything else again, unless you want to buy game mode, and more characters. Minecraft has some skin bundles and costs around $5 and more, the price depends on which skin bundle you want.</p>
