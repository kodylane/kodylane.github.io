				<h2> What Is Halo?&nbsp;</h2>
				<p>Halo is a military science fiction video game. Players battle different aliens on foot and in vehicles to complete quests. Halo is a lot like fortnite but you can't build. Once you complete Halo there is nothing to do, there is little quest to do but you don't get anything from doing them.</p>
				
				<h2>How much is Halo?</h2>
				<p>Halo Infinite costs around $60, after that there is no extra cost. Yet Halo Infinite has brought a daily and weekly item shop. That means players can buy items to bring their own sense of style to the game. Money in Halo is credit, you can buy credit from five different bundles. These bundles are: 500 credits for $7.23, 1000 credits for $14.45, and 2200 credits for $28.91. Items in the item shop in Halo cost different amounts. Every cost is different depending on the rarity.</p>
