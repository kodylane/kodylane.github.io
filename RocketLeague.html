				<h2> What Is Rocket League?&nbsp;</h2>
				<p>Rocket League is a sport based video game. It's a mix of cars and soccer. Like soccer you have to try and get the ball into the goals, but instead of feet you use your car. You can play by yourself and either against the computer or real players. Or if you're playing with friends there's game modes so you're able to play as a team, and vs teams. The way you win is by scoring a goal and whoever has the most points before the timer goes out wins.</p>
				
				<h2>How much is Rocket League?</h2>
				<p>Rocket League is free to play across all platforms. Like most games there is an Item shop. The item shop includes items like painted Cars, player banners, wheels, trails, and more. Each item will have a listed price that will show underneath each item, and each item's price is different. Credits cost $7.55- $75.95, and the more money you spend the more credits you get. For $7.55 you get 500 credits, where $75.95 you get 6500 credits.</p>
