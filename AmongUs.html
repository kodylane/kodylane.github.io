				<h2> What Is Among Us?&nbsp;</h2>
				<p>Among us is an online strategy game. You load in with 9-15 other players and you either load in as a crew mate or Imposter. Crew mates are trying to complete tasks and run away from the imposter. While the imposter runs around sabotaging people and killing players. But the hard part of the game is that the crew mates don't know who the imposter is. There's no blood the character drops to the ground, so it's safe for kids to play. To win the game the crew mates either have to finish all their tasks or vote out the imposter in the meetings. The imposter in order for them to win they have to kill all the crew mates, before they finish all their tasks. </p>
